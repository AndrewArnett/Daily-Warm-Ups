# Git fundamentals (group exercise)

For you warm up this morning you'll need to pull the changes to this repository to your own forks. 

If you navigate to:

```https://www.github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/Daily-Warm-Ups``` 

You'll find a page that looks something like this

Take 5 minutes to read the following post on stack overflow which goes more into  what `upstream` and `downstream` mean in the context of **distributed version control systems** like `git`.

Discuss what advantages and disadvantages such systems provide for:

- employers
- developers
- from a scientific perspective

Share your groups thoughts in the `#ds17` channel on slack.

Take the rest of the time before lecture to go over the days materials in the training kit, and remember to take a short break for 5-10 minutes to get up, walk around or stretch.
